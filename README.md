# Printf

This project is subject to the 42 core curriculum and allowed me to recode the libc's printf function in C. 
The following conversions where handled: 'c', 's', 'p', 'd', 'i', 'u', 'x', 'X' and '%'.

Key learning points of this project were:
  - Handling variadic arguments
  - Organising a complex project with various sub-functions
